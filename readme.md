#  Pastefy 4.0
Pastefy is an Open Source self-hosted Pastebin/GithubGist alternative.

# Contributing
Feel free to improve Pastefy by adding stuff to the code or writing some Github-Issues.

To change something to the code you'll need:
- Knowledge about PHP
- Can work with the [UloleFramework](https://github.com/interaapps/ulole-framework)
- PHP 7.3 CLI installed on your system

We are using ulole-framework compile. You have to type `php cli compile`  in a terminal to compile the resources in the `resource/compile` folder. To test your code you have to start the ulole-framework server `php cli server`. We do not support composer dependencies! Just [UPPM](https://github.com/interaapps/uppm) ones
